Dependencies:
For now, there needs to be an unsecured PostgreSQL and Redis server running on the machine. However, it should be fairly easy to change the login details in main.rb & web-sockets.js.
This also requires ruby, rubygems, nodejs, and npm.

You can install the ruby dependencies by running the command "bundler" and the nodejs dependencies by running "npm install".

Launching:
Once the dependencies are installed and running, you should be able to run a development server by running:
rackup
node web-sockets.js

This launches the main site on port 4567 and the web socket server on 4568.

The production environment is currently setup for use with https://websyn.ca
