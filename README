Dependencies:
For now, there needs to be an unsecured PostgreSQL and Redis server running on the machine. However, it should be fairly easy to change the login details in main.rb & web-sockets.js.
This also requires ruby, rubygems, nodejs, and npm.

You can install the ruby dependencies by running the command "bundler" and the nodejs dependencies by running "npm install".

Launching:
Once the dependencies are installed and running, you should be able to run a development server by running:
rackup
node web-sockets.js

This launches the main site on port 4567 and the web socket server on 4568.

Once the site is running you need to go into the admin panel and configure the script groups.

The production environment is currently setup for use with https://websyn.ca
