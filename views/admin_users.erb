    Sorry that there isn't anything here, but it's a rather low priority. My advice is to try using <code>racksh</code> in console on your production server and get familiar with manipulating DataMapper objects. Users are in a model called <code>User</code>.
    <pre>user = User.get("rice@outerearth.net")
user.password = "Password1"
user.save</pre>
</div>
